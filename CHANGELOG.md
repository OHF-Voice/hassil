# Changelog

## 3.0.1

- Use faster permutation iteration

## 3.0.0

- Rename `Sequence` to `Group`
- Remove `SequenceType` and instead of types for each `Group`:
    - `Sequence` for `(a b c)`
    - `Alternative` for `(a|b|c)`
    - `Permutation` for `(a;b;c)`
- `Sentence` now contains an `expression` field with the parsed expression
- `Permutation` is represented explicitly instead of being expanded internally into an alternative
- Everything used by downstream projects has been moved into a top-level import (`from hassil import Intents`). The internal structure of of hassil (e.g., `hassil.intents` or `hassil.util`) should be expected to change.
- Drop support for Python 3.8 (EOL October 7, 2024)
